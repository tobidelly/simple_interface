### ðŸŒŸ **Key Concepts and Features**

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - **Game Title**: A heading for the interface.
   - **Player Indicator**: Displays which symbol (`X` or `O`) belongs to each player.
   - **Game Board**: A `3x3` grid created using `div` elements with the class `cell`.
   - **Game Status**: Displays which playerâ€™s turn it is.
   - **Reset Button**: A button to restart the game.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - **Grid Layout**: The board uses `CSS Grid` to create a responsive and evenly spaced layout.
   - **Hover Effects**: Subtle changes in cell color when hovered over.
   - **Button Styling**: A styled reset button with hover effects.
   - **Color Coding**: Different colors for player symbols to differentiate them visually.

3. **Intermediate Learning Points**:
   - **Grid-based Layouts**: Mastering `CSS Grid` for creating responsive game boards.
   - **User Interaction Feedback**: Providing visual cues with hover effects.
   - **Consistent Design**: Combining layout, colors, and typography for a clean interface.
