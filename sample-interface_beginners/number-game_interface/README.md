### 🎮 **Beginner Project: Guess the Number Game Interface** 🎲

In this project, you'll create a simple **Guess the Number** game interface using **HTML** and **CSS**. While this is a static project (no JavaScript), it will allow beginners to practice designing a user-friendly interface with buttons, inputs, and text displays. This project focuses on styling and layout, and can later be extended with JavaScript for added functionality.

## 🧠 **Key Concepts for Learning**

1. **HTML Elements**:
   - **Input Field**: To enter the user's guess.
   - **Button**: For submitting the guess.
   - **Div for Result**: To display messages to the user.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - **Forms and Buttons**: Basic input and button styling, adding padding, and making buttons interactive with hover effects.
   - **Layout**: Using `flex` to center the game container on the page.
   - **Responsive Design**: The use of `max-width` to make the input field and button adaptable to different screen sizes.

3. **User Interface Design**:
   - Creating a clean and simple layout with clear instructions and a visually engaging result message.

## 🛠️ **How to Run the Project**

1. **Create the Files**:
   - Create a new folder for the project, and inside that folder, create two files: `index.html` and `styles.css`.
   - Copy the code provided into the respective files.

2. **Open the HTML file**:
   - Open `index.html` in your browser to see the design.

## 🌟 **Enhancements to Try (with JavaScript)**

Once you are comfortable with the design, you can use **JavaScript** to add functionality to the game. Here are some ideas:

1. **JavaScript Logic**: Implement a function that randomly generates a number between 1 and 100 and compares it with the user’s guess to give feedback.
2. **Score Counter**: Keep track of how many guesses it takes to find the correct number.
3. **Guess History**: Display the user's previous guesses to help them.
4. **Game Reset**: Add a button to restart the game once the user guesses correctly.
