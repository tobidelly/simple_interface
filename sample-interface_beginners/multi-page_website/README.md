### ðŸŒŸ **Key Concepts Used**

1. **HTML Navigation**:
   - Each page includes a **navigation bar** with links to all other pages, demonstrating how to link multiple pages together.

2. **Consistent CSS Styling**:
   - A single `styles.css` file is used to maintain consistent design across all pages.

3. **Basic Page Structure**:
   - Each HTML page has a `head` and `body` section with meta tags and a responsive design approach.

4. **Hover Effects**:
   - Simple hover effects are applied to the navigation links for better user experience.
