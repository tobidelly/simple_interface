### 🚗 **Intermediate Project: Car Dashboard Monitor Interface** 🚙

In this project, you will create an interactive **Car Dashboard Monitor** interface using **HTML** and **CSS**. While this interface won't include any JavaScript functionality (just HTML and CSS for now), it will allow you to practice advanced layout techniques and component styling. You’ll design a visually appealing and functional dashboard with multiple elements like speed, fuel level, and warning lights.

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

### **Features**

- **Speedometer**: A circular gauge showing the car's current speed.
- **Fuel Gauge**: A horizontal gauge indicating the fuel level.
- **Warning Lights**: Different indicators for important car statuses (e.g., oil, battery).
- **Car Dashboard Look**: Creating a realistic and appealing car dashboard interface.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface should look good on all screen sizes.

## 📂 **File Structure**

```
dashboard-monitor/
│-- index.html    ← The HTML structure
└-- styles.css    ← The CSS styling
```

---

## 📄 **HTML (`index.html`)**

This HTML file contains the structure of the car dashboard, with different sections representing the speedometer, fuel gauge, and warning lights.

---

## 🎨 **CSS (`styles.css`)**

This CSS file will style the car dashboard to look like a realistic car monitor interface, including the speedometer, fuel gauge, and warning lights.

## 🧠 **Key Concepts for Learning**

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Use of **div** elements for organizing different sections (speedometer, fuel gauge, warning lights).
   - Grouping elements inside divs with appropriate class names (`.gauge`, `.circle`, `.fuel-bar`, `.lights`).

2. **CSS Layout**:
   - **Flexbox**: Used for centering items and distributing space within the dashboard.
   - **Circular Shape**: The `circle` class uses `border-radius` to create the speedometer and warning lights.
   - **Positioning**: The `needle` in the speedometer uses absolute positioning to simulate a rotating needle.
   - **Background Color**: Creating realistic backgrounds and visual effects (e.g., the fuel bar is green and the warning lights change color).

3. **Styling Interactive Elements**:
   - **Hover Effects**: The warning lights change color when hovered over to create an interactive feeling (e.g., a clickable warning light).
   - **Dynamic Width**: The fuel gauge's `width` is styled inline with `style="width: 75%;"`, representing different fuel levels.

## 🛠️ **How to Run the Project**

1. **Create the Files**:
   - Create a folder called `car-dashboard` and inside this folder, create `index.html` and `styles.css`.
   - Copy and paste the code from above into the respective files.

2. **Open the HTML file**:
   - Open `index.html` in your browser to see the car dashboard design.

## 🌟 **Enhancements to Try**

Once you are comfortable with the design, you can extend the project with **JavaScript** to add dynamic functionality:

1. **JavaScript Interaction**: 
   - Use JavaScript to animate the speedometer needle as a user interacts with it.
   - Display dynamic fuel levels based on user input.
   
2. **Fuel Level Logic**: Allow users to modify the fuel level by clicking a button, dynamically changing the fuel bar width.

3. **Responsive Design**: Improve the dashboard's design for mobile screens by using media queries for adjusting element sizes and layouts.
